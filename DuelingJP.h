/*
 * The DuelingJP encapsulates a series of JumpPrime objects, specified when
 * the user instantiates the DuelingJP object. The primary purpose of the
 * DuelingJP object is to count collisions and inversions. A collision occurs
 * when two JumpPrime objects return the same result on an up() call or, in the
 * alternative, a down() call. An inversion occurs when two JumpPrime objects
 * return the same result on alternate calls (i.e., one up(), the other down()).
 *
 * METHODS:
 * 1. The constructor accepts an array of integers representing the number
 * to be encapsulated by each JumpPrime object and an integer representing
 * the number of items in the array. Once a DuelingJP object is instanced,
 * the size and value of the JumpPrime objects cannot be changed by the user.
 * 2. countCollisions is used to count the number of collisions across all of
 * the JumpPrime objects stored in the DuelingJP object. This can be done
 * either in the up() direction or the down() direction.
 * 3. countInversions is used to count the number of inversions across all of
 * the JumpPrime objects stored in the DuelingJP object.This results in two
 * activations of each JumpPrime object in the DuelingJP object (once in the
 * up() direction and once in the down() direction).
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS:
 * 1. When counting collisions, a single JumpPrime object returning a specific
 * value on its own is considered NO COLLISION. Any additional JumpPrime object
 * that returns the same value is considered an added collision. For example,
 * if three JumpPrime objects return the same number on an up() call, then
 * DuelingJP will count TWO (2) COLLISIONS.
 * 2. When counting inversions, unique instances in which the up() result from
 * a JumpPrime object equals the down() result of another JumpPrime object
 * is counted.
 * 3. Anytime the object attempts to count collisions or inversions and an
 * associated JumpPrime has deactivated, the associated method reactivates the
 * object.
 * 4. During the counting of inversions, it is possible for a JumpPrime
 * to jump in between the up(0 and down() call. This is understood and
 * no exceptions are made for it.
